For a C you need to:
read in choleraDeaths.tsv data file
create a Shiny dashboard using R scaled to the classroom wall showing:
table of attacks and deaths by date, showing numbers per day and totals of both on each day
line chart of attacks and deaths, per day and totals of both on that day (note that R has a cumulative sum function that might come in handy), making a total of 4 lines on the chart
allow the user to bring up information on the webpage about who wrote the project, what libraries are being used to visualize it, where the data came from, etc.

For a B you need to add:

read in naplesCholeraAgeSexData.tsv showing fatality numbers for men and women in different age groups from the same time
show a table of male vs female fatalities
show a pie chart of male vs female fatalities
show a bar chart of male vs female fatalities
show a table of age categories for male and female fatalities
show a pie chart of age categories for male and female fatalities
show a bar chart of age categories for male and female fatalities

For an A you need to add:
read in choleraDeathLocations.csv and choleraPumpLocations.csv
show a map of the deaths and pumps on a leaflet map of the current London neighborhood using an appropriately centered leaflet map

Graduate Students need to add:
read in the SnowMapRobinWilson.jpg map (converted by robin@rtwilson.com, www.rtwilson.com/academic to make it match better with the lat lon coordinates)
show a map of deaths and pumps on the original map (note that your plots should match up with Snows, though you will most likely be showing those fatalities in a different way)
allow the user to hover over fatality locations to get data on the number deaths at that location
